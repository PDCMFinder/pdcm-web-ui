The Pediatric Preclinical In Vivo Testing consortium (PIVOT) provides rigorous preclinical testing of novel molecularly targeted agents using in vivo models of pediatric cancer. PIVOT is an extension and expansion of two previous, highly successful NCI programs: Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program ([PPTP](https://ctep.cancer.gov/content/docs/PPTP_Overview.pdf); 2004-2014) and Pedatric Preclinical Testing Consortium ([PPTC](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2015/pptc-awards); 2015-2021). PIVOT consortium members have decades of experience in developing and using in vivo models to advance treatment options for the most common childhood cancers.

The PIVOT PDX Resource contains 261 PDX models from 37 unique pediatric cancers that demonstrate faithful recapitulation of histologies and subtypes. The genomes of engrafted tumors are characterized using whole-exome, whole-transcriptome, SNP genotyping arrays, and STR profiling.

The models here are biased toward the most highly aggressive pediatric cancers and shows a faithful recapitulation of primary and relapsed disease within tumor of origin type through analysis of somatic mutations, copy number alterations, RNA expression, gene fusions, and oncogenic pathways. The genomic annotations will enable rational preclinical agent prioritization and acceleration of therapeutic targets for early-phase pediatric oncology clinical trials.
